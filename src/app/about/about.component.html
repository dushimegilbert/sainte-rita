After their deaths, she joined the <b>community</b> in Cascia, dedicating her life to prayer and service. She received a mystical wound symbolizing Christ’s suffering. She died in <b>1457</b> and was <b>canonized in 1900</b>, becoming the <b>Patronne Sainte of impossible causes and reconciliation</b>.
