                        Sainte Rita of Cascia, born on <b>May 22, 1381</b>, in <b>Roccaporena, Italy</b>, was an Italian widow and Augustinian nun known for her deep faith and devotion. Forced into marriage with a violent husband, she influenced him to change, but he was later murdered. Choosing forgiveness, she encouraged her sons to do the same. After their deaths, she joined the <b> community</b> in Cascia, dedicating her life to prayer and service. She received a mystical wound symbolizing Christ’s suffering. She died in <b>1457</b> and was <b>canonized in 1900</b>, becoming the <b>Patronne Sainte of impossible causes and reconciliation</b>.
